#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

printf("ASCII of %c is %d" , '\n' , (int)('\n'));
                 %c prints the first comma %d prints the second comma
                 %c either takes a command like \n or if more than 1 character is given it returns the last character
                                      #casting a string to an int returns its ASCII code

    return 0;
}
#\n creates new line just like python (newline)
#\0 is null character
#\0 is ASCII 0
